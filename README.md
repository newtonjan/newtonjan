### Hi there, I'm Janine! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a 3rd year computer science student at the University of Toronto. 

* ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a few projects involving web and mobile app development using React, React Native, Express, and MongoDB. 
* ðŸ“š My favourite courses have been data structures and algorithms, computer organization, and systems programming. 
* âš¡ My other interests include watching/reading/writing science fiction, video games, education (I was once a math teacher), camping and hiking, and more - I love to learn and try new things!
